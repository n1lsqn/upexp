# upexp

My Electron application description

## Overview

`upexp` is a desktop application built with Electron, React, and TypeScript. It uses Vite for a fast development experience and Electron Forge to package the application for distribution.

## Tech Stack

-   **Framework:** [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
-   **Frontend:** [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
-   **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
-   **Bundler/Packager:** [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 20 or later is recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd upexp
    ```
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

### Development

To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```sh
npm start
```

## Building the Application

To create a distributable package (e.g., a `.exe` for Windows), run the following command:

```sh
npm run make
```

The output files will be located in the `out` directory.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses [GitHub Actions](/.github/workflows/build.yml) to automatically build the application.

-   **Trigger:** On every push to the `master` branch.
-   **Process:**
    1.  The workflow runs on a `windows-latest` runner.
    2.  It checks out the code, sets up Node.js, and installs dependencies.
    3.  It runs `npm run make` to build the Windows application in a ZIP archive.
    4.  The generated `.zip` archive is uploaded as an artifact named `upexp-installer`.

The artifact can be downloaded from the "Actions" tab of the GitHub repository after a successful run.
